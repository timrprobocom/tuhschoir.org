Auditions are complete, and we have a new set of Crimsonnaires
for the 2016-17 school year. &nbsp;One of the responsibilities
of being a Crimsonnaire is that your family needs to commit
to a few volunteer opportunities. &nbsp;The full form can be 
[downloaded here](http://www.tuhschoir.org/data/uploads/FamilyVolunteerForm.pdf).
Please fill out this form and return it to the Crims meeting
on May 9, or to Mrs Kroeger by May 16.
