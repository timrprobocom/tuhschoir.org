The annual mattress sale is one of the most successful fund-raisers for
the Tualatin High School choir boosters. &nbsp;Held in the Commons, the
sale provides a way for you to get good quality mattresses at a significant
discount over retail, and still have a percentage of each sale go directly
to the boosters.</p>

Make plans to attend on April 9. &nbsp;For more information, check
