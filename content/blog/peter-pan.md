Pan by advertising in the program book.

You can send a personal ad to your cast member, orchestra member, or crew member by filling out the

Send the form with your payment to Kim Kroeger.

If you'd like to place a larger ad in the book, from business card size to full-page, please fill out our 
[program book ad form](http://tuhschoir.org/data/uploads/PeterPanAdvertisementForm.pdf). 
Send the form, your ad copy, and your payment to Kim Kroeger.
