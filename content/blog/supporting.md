This amazing vocal music program will only continue to thrive with the support
of parents and here are several options for you to be a part of it:

1. <u>Volunteering:</u> We use volunteers to donate concession goods, hand out
programs, run concessions at concerts, organize and/or participate in smaller
fundraisers throughout the year, chaperone events, and work at the yearly
mattress sale and at our huge fireworks stand. See the sign up sheets posted
in the choir room, watch for requests via our monthly newsletter or from our
volunteer coordinator, Charlene Carlberg, 
[ccarlberg4@gmail.com](mailto:ccarlberg4@gmail.com). We have
approximately 200 volunteer spots to fill each school year, just to keep this
machine up and running. We request that each family commit to 2 or more
volunteer spots per school year.

2. <u>Business Sponsorship:</u> Do you own your own business? We are looking for
businesses to sponsor the TuHS Choir Program. Please see Business
Sponsorship flyer for details or email Jennifer Bosket, 
[jenniferbof3@gmail.com](jenniferbof3@gmail.com).

3. <u>Corporate Matching Program:</u> Does your place of employment match
charitable donations to non-profits? If so, our information is:
TuHS Choir Boosters TIN/EIN: 80-0402013

4. <u>Concert Raffle Items:</u> We are looking for highly desirable items that can be
raffled off at our concerts. Examples would be: tickets to local sporting events,
paid weekend getaways, dinner/movie gift cards, high quality wine/cheese/food
baskets, gift certificates for local services, etc. If you have something you
would consider donating, please contact Shailu Pasumamula,
[pasumamu@gmail.com](pasumamu@gmail.com) .

5. <u>Amazon Smile:</u> Go to Smile.amazon.com and choose “Tuhs Choir Boosters”
as your charity. When you shop at smile.amazon.com, we earn 0.5%.
