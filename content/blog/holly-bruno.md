Holly Bruno is an 8-year-old girl in the Tigard-Tualatin School
District who was recently diagnosed with a rare form of cancer
called rhabdomyosarcoma.  You can read about Holly's story at 
[sparrowclubs.org/sparrows/holly_bruno](http://sparrowclubs.org/sparrows/holly_bruno).

Tualatin High School is helping to pay for Holly's treatment with a benefit
concert on April 12 at the TuHS Auditorium, featuring jazz pianist Randy Porter,
the Crosswinds Big Band, the TuHS Vocal Jazz Ensemble, and members of the TuHS
choir.  Donations will be taken at the door. &nbsp;Please click the image
