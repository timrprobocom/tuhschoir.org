The largest and most successful fundraisers for the choir each
year is our fireworks stand in the Tualatin Fred Meyer parking
lot. The fireworks stand will be operational from June
30 through July 4. Although the stand is only open for
sales from 9 AM to 9 PM, we need volunteers to man the stand 24
hours a day, for security purposes. &nbsp;It is important that
we have enough volunteers. &nbsp;Please contact Jennifer Bosket at

to discuss how you can help us. You may click on the image to
