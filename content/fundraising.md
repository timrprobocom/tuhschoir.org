# Fund Raising

Students' individual opportunities, outreach to the local community,
and direct contributions to the booster organization are some of the
types of fundraising opportunities used for the choir program.

Fundraisers that earn money for the student.s individual account include
Scrip, and can also include Entertainment Books, HoneyBaked Hams,
ButterBraids, and See.s Candy sells.  Funds raised by the students
are deposited directly into the student.s personal choir account and
are tracked by the boosters. treasurer.  To use the funds for choir
expenses such as choir dresses, tuxedos, competition fees, choir trips,
or production t-shirts, the choir student completes a Transfer Form that
is obtained from Mrs. Kroeger.

Fundraisers that reach out to the local community are Pass the Hat
at choir concerts, Winter Concert.s Silent Auction, recycling, concert
concession sells, business sponsorships, Oregon Sporting Clay Tournament,
rummage sale, Singing Valentines for students at TuHS, and the Annual
Fire Works Tent. These funds are used for choir expenses not covered by
school funds.

Direct donations made by cash or check can be mailed to TuHS Choir Booster
