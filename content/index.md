# Welcome!

The Tualatin High School choir department has provided education and
training in vocal music to students since the founding of the high school
in 1992.  Under the direction of Kim Kroeger, the Concert Choir, the
Crimsonnaires, the Treble Choir, and the Cadet Choir represent Tualatin
High School.

The TuHS Choir Boosters is a volunteer organization set up to assist
the students with opportunities to grow in their knowledge of music and
the performing arts.  It is our desire to supplement our studentsâ€™
current education in a way that will prove meaningful to both the choir
and our community.

Here are some of the ways the Choir Boosters have supported the choirs:

* Assist in the annual production of a full Broadway-style musical
* Purchase of sheet music
* Purchase of choir risers, sound equipment and microphones
* Purchase of Choir robes
* Accompanist fees
* Choir trips
* Competition fees
* Chaperones

We have wonderful opportunities for local business sponsorships,
in exchange for having your business listed in our concert programs,
newsletters, and Facebook feed.  For more information, please check out
this flyer.

The Choir Boosters have many volunteer opportunities and we invite all choir parents to become involved.
Please see our [Volunteer page](volunteers).

Our general meeting is held on the second Monday of each month in the choir room from 7:00-8:00 pm.  These meetings are a great way to meet other choir parents and gain information about choir events.
