# tuhschoir.org

This repo is a backup of tuhschoir.org, the web site for  the Tualatin High
School Choir Boosters.  The web site was active through about 2018, but 
upon the retirement of director Kim Kroeger, the boosters have chosen to
go another direction.

The web site uses the miniature content management system "Pico".
